## A Tale of Two Timelines

The following is an introduction to a self-produced & recorded post-apocalyptic movie to be shown as a demo video in a video production workshop provided to students of GENED1001 (Stories from the end of the world) on 11/19/2020.

Students in GENED1001 were producing their own apocalyptic videos for their final projects, and the idea for this type of apocalyptic video was to write, record, and edit an intro to the video in the four hours we had to work before the workshop.

Given that this was a rather short timeline, it was important to map out all of the elements that needed to be produced -- and in what order -- so that the video could be completed in time for the workshop.
