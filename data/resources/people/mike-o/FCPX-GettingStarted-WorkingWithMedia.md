# FCPX - Getting Started - Creating Libraries, Projects, and working with media

Effective media management in any video editing software program is incredibly important, and Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) is no different. Keeping your media organized -- and preferably in one location on an external drive -- can save you a lot of time and headaches over the course of your project.

But effective media management is not just about holding onto your files in a singular location so that FCPX can find and link to your media. It's also about organizing your media inside FCPX, so that you can access and edit your media very quickly.

### Creating and using folders for your media

Here is a very short video that shows you how to create folders (called "Events") inside your FCPX library, to more effectively organize your media:

And here is an additional, supplemental video that discusses media management in FCPX in greater detail:

### Optimizing your project and import settings

In general, it is important (and good practice!) to be aware of the dimensions and resolution of the media that you're working with when doing any digital creative project. This is especially true in FCPX.

The following video walks you through how you can assess the size of the media that you are working with, and then match your project settings inside FCPX accordingly. It also includes some tips and guidance on preference settings that can help you avoid unintentionally creating a large-sized and bloated Library.

### Relinking media

Sometimes when moving media files around, or when taking your Library and media to work on a new computer, FCPX needs a little help in relinking and pointing to your media. Worry not! This is usually quick and painless, provided that you still have access to all of the media files that you are using in your Library.

Here is a video that shows you how to quickly relink your media:

Hopefully this helps you get started on working quickly and efficiently with your media in FCPX. Good luck!
