Ok, so I think I accomplished a pretty cool thing for my first ever time trying OBS.


## Here are my Top tips:

### For a really nice cinematic video of self:
1. r-click your Video Capture Device to get to Filters
2. Add these Filters:
    1. Apply LUT
    2. Sharpness
    3. Chroma Key
3. Hover over your video in the preview and hit command E to bring up the Scene Transform.


You will want to make similar adjustments as seen in the following screen caps:


##### Apply LUT 
Path-Browse = ...teal_lows_orange_highs.png
Amount = 0.82

##### Sharpness
= 0.13

##### Chroma Key
Gamma = -0.38
Contrast = 1.22
Brightness = -0.08
Hue Shift = 11.79
Opacity = 100

##### Scene Item Transform
Size = 1920 x 1080
Crop Top and Bottom = 100

And there you have it, folks! It's almost a folklore filter or something equally as gorgeous!

Next, I played around with adding text, and doing overlays with videos I brought in as well as a webpage on Hegel (which you can see the gif of at the top of this report!)
