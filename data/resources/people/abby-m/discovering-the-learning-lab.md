1.	What class did you first come with? What activities did you work on while you were in the Learning Lab?

I first came to the Learning Lab through Expos 20: Journey to Mars. Our professor, Ramyar, was always going above and beyond to take learning outside of the classroom, from viewing parties to museum trips, the class was very interactive. I’m so thankful that he created that experience for us, it was such a great welcome to courses at Harvard, but I’m most thankful that he brought us into the Learning Lab. We went twice for this course, but the first time was an analysis of the movie “The Martian”. We came in and the Learning Lab staff had cut frame-by-frame shots of the first 5 minutes of the movie and had them laid out across multiple tables. As groups, we picked certain scenes out that we felt explained one of the central themes of the plot and cinematography that we had discussed in class. We also used green colored paper to greenscreen the movie onto it and write on it during our presentation, which is still one of my favorite tools in the Learning Lab. It opened up a whole new world of ways to analyze and discuss media that left me feeling really excited about writing my expos paper. 

2.	What was your first impression of the Learning Lab?

I thought (and still think!) the Learning Lab was the coolest place I had ever been to. The space itself is just so incredible, from the colorful stools to the chalkboard wall to the trusses and live-recording monitors, I just remember thinking this is such a creative space and I am so happy to be here. One of the thoughts that popped in to my head on that first day was “everyone needs to know about this place”. It was my first semester freshman year and I still wish I had found the Learning Lab sooner. I spent all week telling my friends about how much I loved it and what I had done with my class there. I still think the Learning Lab is an amazing, wonderful, creative space and resource that should be a part of every student’s time at Harvard. 

3.	When did you decide to apply to be a LLUF?

I accidentally went to a job fair in the spring of my freshman year (I was going to study with my friends in the Oasis at Memorial Church and didn’t know there was a job fair going on). I decided to walk around anyways since I was starting to settle in at Harvard and had thought about a campus job and that’s where I met Katie! I was telling her all about my experience with the Learning Lab through my expos class and she was so welcoming and excited with me, I knew I had to apply. I ended up interviewing at the end of my freshman spring and starting as a LLUF in the summer.
