# Pen Tool: the Basics

If you've ever used an Adobe program before, it's likely that you've used the Pen tool at some point. The very basic function is to create two points, that you can apply fine-tuned control to the bezier curve in between.

In After Effects, the Pen tool can be used to create shape layers, masks, paths, effect keyframe interpolations and adjust fonts. It's so prevalent within the Adobe Suite, [there's even a browser game designed to hone your skills](https://bezier.method.ac/)
