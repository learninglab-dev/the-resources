# Embedding an Audio File in a Spark Page

Unfortunately, there isn't a very elegant solution to this problem of embedding audio. You might be able to do this on a Canva page, if you're dedicated to only having the audio. But we have found a workaround, specifically for Spark.

What you'll want to do is:

- import your podcast into a Spark Video page, [here's a short walkthrough on how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KPiqEP7a68)
- add some kind of splash image, if this were an album, this could be your album cover, for a TED Talk, maybe just a portrait. This is mostly just to help make it discoverable
- once you have your podcast successfully turned into a video, just hit **Share** and **Publish**, and this will give you a link to embed in your Spark Page!

From here, you should have an embeddable podcast link for your Spark Page!
