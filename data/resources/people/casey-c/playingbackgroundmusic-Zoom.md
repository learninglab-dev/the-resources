# Playing Music in the Background over Zoom

We get frequently get asked how you might play some background music in Zoom. This is super simple to do, but there are some considerations that can optimize how it plays back.

To share your audio, all you need to do is to press **Share Screen**, navigate to the **Advanced** tab and select **Share Computer Audio**. From here, whatever you play in your media app will be played through Zoom.

### The Considerations:

Just like with most things in the remote world, there are several ways you can optimize the playback.

- Check your volume before hitting **Play**
    - Zoom automatically sets your computer to full volume when you share your computer audio(this is also true when sharing your screen with audio). So to prevent blasting everyone in the room with music, double check your audio first!

    - Another good way around this is to set the volume in your media app to half volume, that way you don't have to monitor the volume every time you hit Share.

- Wear headphones
    - The music plaything through your speakers will be picked up by your microphone, this will trigger Zoom to suppress your microphone. The music won't be effected, but your voice will, headphones will prevent that from happening.

- Use an ethernet cable to connect to your router
    - Wifi is fantastically convenient, but when it comes to getting as good a connection as you can, nothing will beat a wired connection!

- Refresh your computer and your router frequently
    - It can be beneficial to restart all your devices on a fairly regular basis. Sometime routers can go months without a restart, often times until it starts to present issues. It can help to keep out in front of those glitches by restarting it once a week.
