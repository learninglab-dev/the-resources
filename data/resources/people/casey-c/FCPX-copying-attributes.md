# Copying Attributes Between Clips

In Final Cut Pro X, there's a ton of different situations that you might want to move attributes between clips. If you're doing color corrections on footage that has an imprecise white balance, vignetting a scene, or applying a tiling effect across a dozen clips. This will save huge amounts of time with relatively little effort.

The process is extremely simple.
