# Getting Started in Final Cut Pro X

You can install FCPX through the App Store, but if you're applying your educational discount, keep in mind that you might want to buy it first [through Apple's Education portal](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/product/BMGE2Z/A/pro-apps-bundle-for-education), before [opening the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12) and downloading it.

If you're looking to test this out before deciding to buy it, they do have [a 90 day free trial available.](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/trial/)

### Importing Footage

To start yourself off, you're going to need a *Library* to work in. These are essentially the file FCPX builds to manage your media. `File` > `New` > `Library`

Next up, you'll be given two *Events*, today's date, and "Smart Collections". Events are just FCPX's system of folders. A good practice is to start off creating two of them: "Footage" and "Projects". You can just rename the date, or go to `File` > `New` > `Events`(Opt + N)

Now, you'll be given a nice "Import Media" button to start you off, but you can also `File` > `Import` > `Media`(Cmd + I)

- If you're confident that your footage is in a friendly codec, you can choose to select "Leave Files in Place". Otherwise, FCPX will make a copy of all your footage(could be a significant amount of data) and rewrap it into something Apple plays nicer with.

This will open up a File Browser, just navigate to your footage, select it and hit *Import Selected*

### Creating a Timeline

Next up, you'll need a timeline to arrange all this footage into, in your Project event `File` > `New` > `Project`(Cmd + N)

![FCPX Project Settings](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F01NAGZJN7P/newproject.png?pub_secret=f645d6d372)

From here, you can normalize your project settings to what you shot your footage in. I recommend paying close attention to *Resolution* and *Rate*, most others will be selected automatically -- you can always change this later, if needed.

Finally, you're ready to edit, simply grab some of your footage and drag it down onto your timeline!
