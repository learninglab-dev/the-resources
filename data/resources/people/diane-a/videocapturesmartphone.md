#### Practical Resources for Optimizing Smartphone Video Capture

**Lighting** is one of the most important elements to harness when creating compelling video content. And even though smartphones are generally very good at automatically adjusting settings for exposure, the choices that you make in terms of lighting, along with your smartphone and your subject's proximity to those sources of light, will drastically affect the look and feel of the video you capture.

You will of course need to experiment a bit in order to nail the look that you are hoping to achieve (and you should have fun with this while you do!). But while there are many things to think about as you set up your shots, here's a great resource video created by Casey, at the Learning Lab, for how you might approach addressing lighting concerns while filming yourself on a smartphone camera. Check it out!

So while controlling and leveraging the light in and around your home is certainly a challenge, but it's one that you can at least manipulate and assert some control over! But what about when you are out in the physical world, and you have to cope with the weather, along with other physical elements (buildings, structures, etc.) that you are not able to alter in any physical way? Here is another great video that the Learning Lab's Casey produced, trying to assess and offer some solutions to those potential issues. Please take a look.

Alright wait a minute! So at this point you have experimented and identified a compelling manner in which to set up your shots and frame your subject for your smartphone video. You have explored how best to utilize the light in your environment to capture your subject effectively. And just as you think you might be ready to record, you realize that you don't have a solid tool for stabilizing your smartphone so that you can capture a consistent and stable shot!

Well worry not! You do not need to own a tripod for this. In fact, there are many materials that you can use from around your house to build your own! Here's Casey again, offering a video showing how you can build your own with just a knife and some cardboard.

And here is an externally-produced video from CNET showing how you can very easily build your own at-home tripods using just binder clips, a plastic card, or a disposable coffee cup! Go get your DIY on, and good luck!
