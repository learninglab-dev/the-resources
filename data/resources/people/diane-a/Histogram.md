  * In the Library Module you can edit your images in the Quick Develop tab. It offers few options

  * In the Develop Module you can edit images in much greater detail. The left hand column has some presets and also a history list option if you need to back up from what you did

  * The basic tab on the right offers many ways to manipulate the image

In photography and video clipping refers to certain areas that fall outside the minimum and maximum intensity that can be captured. In other words, there isn't any information at that part of the image.  Lightroom represents these areas with blue for black clipping and red for white clipping. The two triangles on the top corners of the historgram show these areas when selected.
