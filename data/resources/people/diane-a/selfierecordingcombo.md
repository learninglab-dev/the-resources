# Best practices for smartphone / selfie video recording

Not long ago we would never consider shooting high quality videos on our smartphones since the results were so inferior compared to a camera. Today smartphone quality is much improved and you can't beat the convenience. We now have incredibly powerful cameras sitting right in our pockets!

Here are the four main types of considerations that you should think about when approaching the production of your own selfie video:
## Framing / Composition

#####	* Shooting in Landscape (Horizontally)
  - Place the camera at least at eye level or slightly above. Experiment and see what you like
  - Pay attention to the background
  - Look directly into the lens
  - Position yourself to one side of the frame
  - Allow a little headroom
  - Place the bottom of the frame just below the chest

### Environment
	When possible, it's great to make the environment your filming in contextually-related to the subject matter of your video.
##### *  The vertical vs. horizontal debate
	It wasn't long ago that vertically-shot videos/portrait, as opposed to horizontal/landscape, were shunned as an inferior approach to smartphone video recording, but that is changing now that this form of filming (is the most intuitive and natural when holding a smartphone), and is also the most prevalent form of shooting on social media platforms. As a result, it is really up to you to decide which is best for your needs.
	A couple things to think about:

		-What is the platform that this will be viewed on? If on Facebook, Twitter, Snap Chat, etc., it may be best to shoot in vertical.
		-If this will be on Youtube, Vimeo, or on a website, perhaps it may be better to shoot horizontally.
		-If you are going to be editing this footage with other visual material, it may be a good idea to align your shooting in the same format as your other media.

	Here is a video produced at the Bok Center that demonstrates a few of these suggestions:

## Lighting

* Natural and diffused light (e.g., sunlight through a translucent window shade) are great for selfie videos
* It is often good to position your face at roughly 45 degrees from your light source, so you can create a gentle shadow on one side of your face.

##### * Recording Indoors
 * Use natural sunlight when possible
 * Pay attention to the position of the camera (don't put the camera facing the window)
 * Pay attention to the position of your body
 * Watch out for glare in glasses
 * Try to schedule your shoot when the sunlight is the best

 ##### * Recording Outside

* Pay attention to the direction of the sunlight
* How powerful is it
* How much of the shot is in or out of sunlight

## Audio

##### * Shooting Outside

* When recording outside, do your best to find a time when it's not too windy and in a location that is not overwhelmingly noisy from other sources (cars, construction, dogs barking, etc.)
* The phone's on board mic will pick up a lot of external noise
* Earbuds will sound much better, but not look as good because you can see the wires.
* A lavalier microphone will look and sound better, but it is an extra purchase. You can also use it with your computer. If using an iPhone, you will need to use a lightning to 3.5mm headphone adaptor

##### * Shooting Inside

* Same tips as recording outside except for wind noise. But there could be other background noises (refrigerators, fans, air conditioners, etc.)

## Delivery

##### * Before You Start recording

* Practice, write out your script, think about what you want to say - the more comfortable you are with the material, the better the delivery will be
* Be personable! Make sure to smile and speak with emotion
* Gentle hand gestures, as long as they don't affect the stability of the shot, can be effictively employed as well
* Redo a take as often as needed
* To help with file size, shoot your video in smaller segments
	* This also makes it easier not to make a mistake
* Keep track of what take you are on at the beginning of each segment to help you locate your best recordings
