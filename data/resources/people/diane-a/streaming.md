Here is where you tell OBS what resolution, frame rate, and audio bitrate you want your stream to be set to as well as what streaming service you want to use and get your stream key

Under the Stream tab you can choose your streaming service, server and request a stream key.

With the Output tab selected you have a choice of a Simple or Advanced Output Mode - Take note of the warnings at the bottom of the window.
Simple Output Mode should work, but if you have a fast upload speed, you can get more control in the Advanced mode

Tell OBS to Start streaming

![](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F01KBEQBSE6/startstreaming.png?pub_secret=ee04714fbf)

Your stream will appear in your YouTube Studio window. Here you can edit the title of your stream, add a description, select a category, start a chat, choose who will be able to view it and end the stream. You have to tell OBS to Stop Streaming also

If you select the share arrow in the upper right-hand corner, you will get a window with the URL link to send to participants. There are two ways to copy it.

When a participant pastes the link in a browser, the stream appears, but with a delay, maybe up to 10 or so seconds

You can also start a live chat in two directions. Remember to stop a stream you need to do so in YouTube Studio as well as OBS.
