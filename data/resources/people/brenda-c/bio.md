### Biography

Hello! My name is Brenda (they/them/theirs) and I am a sophomore proudly reprsenting Adams House from home in Los Angeles, CA. I am concentrating in Romance Languages and Literature with a secondary in Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights. I have been working for the Learning Lab since the fall of my freshman year. I enjoy studying how art and creative projects can be incoprated into course assignments. I also am interested in researching the workflows of students from various fields of study to create resource guides for incoming first-year students. Whether on-campus or over Zoom, the Learning Lab is a place where I can tap into my creativity, collaborate and learn from talented LLUFs, and brainstorm projects to improve the classroom experience, as our learning environments are rapidly being transformed.
