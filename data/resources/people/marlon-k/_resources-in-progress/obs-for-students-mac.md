# SETTING UP OBS ON YOUR MAC

here are the steps:
1. [download and install OBS](https://obsproject.com/download) (or use homebrew: `brew cask install obs`)
2. download and install a virtual camera plugin if you want to use OBS with Zoom:
	- John Boiles's [obs-mac-virtualcam](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam) can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/releases) or installed with homebrew (`brew cask install obs-virtualcam`)
	- [NDI](https://ndi.tv/tools/)'s suite of tools can be downloaded [here](https://ndi.tv/tools/#download-tools). You'll need to install the
		- **NDI Virtual Input**
		- the **NDI/HX Driver**
		- the **NDI Video Monitor**
		- and then the macOS-compatible NDI-runtime, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases)
	- the other option is [CamTwist Studio](http://camtwiststudio.com/), which you can actually use on its own **without** OBS
