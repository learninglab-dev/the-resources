There are tons of settings under the hood on how to optimize your Zoom session recordings. This page will guide you through how to turn them on.

Note: You'll have to be the meeting creator in order for this to work!

1. Start by going to [zoom.harvard.edu](zoom.harvard.edu).
2. Click **Recordings** in the panel on the left, then click **Settings**.
