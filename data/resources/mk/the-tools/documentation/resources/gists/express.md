### Routing

from this [link](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
Since the hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally, they can be used along with route parameters for useful purposes.

```
Route path: /flights/:from-:to
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/flights/LAX-SFO
req.params: { "from": "LAX", "to": "SFO" }
Route path: /plantae/:genus.:species
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/plantae/Prunus.persica
req.params: { "genus": "Prunus", "species": "persica" }
```
