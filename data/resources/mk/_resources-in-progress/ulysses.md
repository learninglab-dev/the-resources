# Ulysses

The [Ulysses App][3] (available in the [App Store][4]) is a great all-purpose writing app, and works exceedingly well if you want to give your whole writing life over to it—which really wouldn't be a crazy idea if you have relatively standard needs as a writer).
Even if you do have more specialized needs (the need to commit `.md` files to multiple different git repositories, say, or need to embed videos and interactive elements) you can still use it for a large chunk of your workflow.

## good stuff
* one stop shop for organizing, drafting, previewing and exporting (to web, print, etc.)
* slick interface
* there's an iOS app too

## drawbacks
* doesn't cope with YAML front matter (which is suboptimal if you are creating files for a [Gatsby][5] page, say)
* takes away control of file-naming (it simply names the file after the first line, minus any `#` tags — which also means you can't even really use a YAML if you want reasonably-named docs)
* subscription = $$$ you may not want to spend


## tutorials
This is a pretty intuitive app, but if you are looking for a quick tutorial, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fytWWW9QOts) isn't bad.
