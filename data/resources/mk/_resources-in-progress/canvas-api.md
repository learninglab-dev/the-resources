# CANVAS API RESOURCES

If and when we build something with the canvas API, here are some useful links.

* [live API testing machine](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/live#!/modules.json/create_module_post_2)
* [interesting sandbox Canvas site on using canvas for developers](https://kth.instructure.com/courses/11) written by someone at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm
* [Canvas LMS API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html) intro and everything else
* docs on the [modules api](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/modules.html) specifically
* [canvas-lms github repo](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki) if we want to run a dev version ourselves
* and [this canvas dev & friends](https://instructure.github.io/) site really seems like the key place to go to get started
* their quick intro to LTI tool development is [here](https://www.eduappcenter.com/docs/basics/index).
* and the longer docs are [here](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability)
* [another great page on using the Canvas APIs](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-14390-canvas-apis-getting-started-the-practical-ins-and-outs-gotchas-tips-and-tricks#jive_content_id_Tips_for_getting_started_and_some_useful_resources) from the canvas community site.
