# OBS STEP BY STEP
These are just the steps--not much more. Over time we can add a little bit more context.
1. [download and install OBS](https://obsproject.com/download) (or use homebrew: `brew cask install obs`)
2. if you want to add the NDI tools (currently the easiest way to get you audio mix from OBS to Zoom), then you'll also want to
	1. download [NDI](https://ndi.tv/tools/)'s suite of tools from [this link](https://ndi.tv/tools/#download-tools). 
	2. install the **NDI Virtual Input**
	3. install the **NDI/HX Driver**
	4. install the **NDI Video Monitor**
	5. install the macOS-compatible NDI-runtime, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases)
3.
