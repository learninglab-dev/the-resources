# THE ART OF CODE

This is intended to be a repository of short, modular tutorials and tips on web development, scripting, complex software of various sorts, etc. -- all designed for absolute beginners who may be coming to code from the Arts and Humanities rather than a STEM field.

As a tester, we're hoping that you'll try the modules out and then

1. show us your work by sending in links, as usual
2. let us know how LONG the "instructional" portion of the module took you to complete (in minutes)
3. let us know how
