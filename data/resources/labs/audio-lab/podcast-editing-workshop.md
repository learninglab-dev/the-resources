This page contains links that may be helpful during the [Bok Center Learning Lab's](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) Podcasting Workshop for EXPOS 20 Language, Identity, and Power.

Over the course of this workshop, we are going to 
1. tour some options for recording and editing in a variety of different software tools. 
3. spend some time in breakout rooms devoted to each of the following applications:

* [Garageband](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/expos20-schwab/garageband)
* [Soundtrap](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/expos20-schwab/soundtrap)

We can also help out with any questions you have about Logic or Ableton if you decide to go with one of those tools instead.
