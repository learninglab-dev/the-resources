## MOTION CAPTURE - A (very) quick primer

#### What is Motion Capture?
The process of recording the 3D movement of objects or people

#### How it's achieved

Actors wear small reflective sensors, often on the joints, that are then tracked by a number of cameras over time.

Location & movement data is captured from image sensors on the cameras, to triangulate the 3D position of a subject or subjects.

#### Motion Capture Software

#### Some advantages of Motion Capture

* Real time previewing - More feedback can enhance an actor’s performance
* Provides the ability to capture complex movement and realistic physical interactions
* MOCAP Can reduce post-production costs when compared to keyframe-based animation

#### Some challenges in Motion Capture

* MOCAP can be VERY expensive - The cost of hardware, software, and personnel can be prohibitive for smaller productions
* “Fix it in Post” doesn’t work as well in this medium - When problems occur, it’s sometimes easier to reshoot rather than manipulate already-captured data
