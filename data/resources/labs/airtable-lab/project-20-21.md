## the goals

to learn a little bit about airtable, and ultimately about ourselves.

## the projects

### the Bok Database ###

The Bok Center does lots of things, and will need lots of related data in its database to track these things. We're working on a [series of docs](/simple/labs/airtable-lab/00-airtable-) that lay out some database basics

### Global Feminisms Music Video Database ###
One of our LLUFs will be working on a database of music videos for a course on Global Feminisms. Interesting elements of this project include
* devising a data model for music videos: what are their salient properties? what are the one-to-many relationships we might want to track?
* grabbing playlist data from Spotify to populate the airtable
* moving data (music video urls, video length, video dimensions, etc) from YouTube to Airtable
* moving song analysis data from Spotify to Airtable using the Spotify API
* getting artist data and relevant links from Wikipedia, Spotify, allmusic, Pandora, etc
* using the airtable to create web views and interactions
* connecting airtable to canvas
* connecting airtable to scalar


## the future
