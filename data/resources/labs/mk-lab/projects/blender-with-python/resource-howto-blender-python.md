# BLENDER & PYTHON #
(together)

so, If you don't know either of these right now, this could be intimidating. But don't let it be! The whole reason we're doing these two together is to make the standard "intro Python" tutorial **more** interesting than it typically is.

## THE SCRIPTING TAB ##

So the first thing you're going to want to do is to click the "scripting" tab at the top of the interface. This will give you a window layout appropriate for scripting (though we have to say . . . that text editor window is definitely a little large! maybe make it a little narrower and make your 3d viewer a little larger)


## CREATING OBJECTS ##

let's start out by simply creating a couple of objects, first in the the Blender GUI, then in Python.

_now we can run through the basic "create the primitives" stuff, but each time check in the console to see what happens_






- python and blender
	- function that creates an underlined number or text
	- then typical intro python stuff
		- addition, subtraction, multiplication, operators
		- if else
		- loops
		- functions
		- classes
	- create arrays of things
	- simple dataVis (bar graphs, etc.)
	- something with a map?
	- bring in other objects and make visualizations with them
