# TUTORIALS FOR CHRISTIE #

we need to create a number of things at the intersection of blender and python. one interesting development => given the fact that students learning python in the sciences and social sciences are going to be using `matplotlib`, it could make sense to have the learning trajectory we create match what they encounter with `matplotlib`.

so if the very first thing is simply 


## ELEMENTS ##
things to do/create:
* basic scatterplot
* axes
* line plot
* histogram
* population pyramids?
* streamplot (weather?)
* monochromatic and multichromatic color-scales
* bar charts
* pie charts
*
