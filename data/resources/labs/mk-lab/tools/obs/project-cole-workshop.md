EXPOS20Cole October 6 draft plan

Plan for October 6:

Ask students to submit a video in advance.
Students record 30 seconds into their phone, upload it 3 days before the workshop.
Where are you from originally and what were you expecting before you came to Harvard, what has surprised you?
Ask them to introduce themselves and where they are from. Are they voting in MA or in their hometown district? What are the 538 polling numbers where they are voting?
Using pre-filmed student videos, show them 3 options to give them an idea of outcomes
Everyone has to learn how to record videos/interviews
Technical nuts and bolts motivated by the storytelling moves they want to perform (cohesive video and audio, how important is it and how to capture it).
How to conduct an interview and how to record it over Zoom
Who is the imagined audience and how will they consume this thing?
What kinds of questions get interesting answers and why?
Collectively generate the initial set of questions that might be asked, starting with small breakout sessions
Will want early questions to get asked a month away from the election.
