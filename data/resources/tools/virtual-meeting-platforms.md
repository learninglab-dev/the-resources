# Virtual Meeting Platforms

Here's a list of virtual meeting platforms, beyond just Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet.
Note: Text is mostly copied from the internet!

## [here.fm](https://here.fm/l)

Here is a fully customizable room with video chat built on top of it, giving users the ability to decorate their room with virtual items, gifs, backgrounds, notes, pictures, etc. And, of course, these users can also customize their own video chat window and those of others, arranging them in the room in the size and shape that they prefer. As with any other video chat software, users can also share their screen.

## [SpatialChat](https://spatial.chat/)

SpatialChat has many of the same features as here.fm, but seems to be positioned as a more professional alternative. It allows you to set up a room where users can move themselves around a 2D space to move between groups of people or embedded objects (such as a Youtube video or image).

## [Kumospace](https://www.kumospace.com/)

Free immersive video chat built for groups. Spatial audio enables multiple simultaneous conversations in the same space. Rich illustrations, interactive apps, and customizable environments.

## [Gather.Town](https://gather.town/)

Gather. Town is essentially a web-conferencing software like Zoom, but with the added component of seeing the virtual “room” you and others are occupying, and with the ability to move around and interact with other participants based on your locations in the room, just like real life. Visually, it looks like an 8-bit video game.

Fluid video chat - Walk in and out of conversations as naturally as in real life

Objects & integrations:
* Whiteboards

## [Topia.io](https://topia.io/)

Check this out if you're interested in the functionality of Gather.town but turned off by the video game aesthetic. Much like Gather.Town, Topia is a spatial media platform that combines playful world-building with encrypted video chat. Customize using ready-to-use kits or create your own. Host 500+ in-world for dinners, podcasts, concerts, conferences, and more.
Topia.io comes with a gallery of pre-made assets with which to customize your space, allowing you to maintain their signature look.

## [Confer-O-Matic](https://www.conferomatic.com/)

Interactive 3D virtual space for large online events. Like GatherTown and Topia.io, Confer-O-Matic allows users to freely move around an event space, but unlike the others it creates a virtual 3D`Second Life`-like world. Participants have 3D physical representations in the world with a video chat window that floats above their character model. Confer-O-Matic supports live streamed talks, chat through voice & video and much more.

## [Remo](https://remo.co/)
![Remo-gif](https://remo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3rd-value-animation-4.gif)
A meeting platform with a vitual networking interface that lets you move between tables and display table topics.
In speaker mode there is also a integrated Q&A mode in the chat box.

## [Airmeet](https://www.airmeet.com/)
![airmeet-image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GpvjcNjPE6TSWFJGvMhK1w.jpeg)
Airmeet is an all-in-one events platform for hosting virtual & hybrid conferences, meet-ups, expos, and fairs. The platform gives you the control to brand and customize your session stage, social lounge, reception, booths, and more.

## [Hopin](https://hopin.com/)
![hopin-image](https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/1d3d3fbe-5049-4b0e-aac1-31ea3f1d374f.jpg)
Hopin is a platform for hosting large online events. There are a number of venue types:
* Stage is where your presentations or keynotes become visible for up to 100,000 attendees. Broadcast live, play pre-recorded content or stream via RTMP - the Stage always delivers attendees the real conference experience.
* Sessions promote real-time live interactions. Up to 20 attendees can be on one screen with hundreds attendees watching and chatting. With unlimited Sessions that can run at the same time, it's a perfect place for roundtables, group talks, project-related discussions.
* Networking allows to get to know people on your event. Expand your network with random or ticket type-based matching and have engaging 1:1 meetings to connect with event attendees.
* Expo area is great for all kinds of exhibitions, such as trade shows or fairs, where event-goers can “walk around” to visit the booths that interest them, interact with the vendors, and take action. Each booth at your event can contain live video, branded content, Twitter links, pre-recorded videos, special offers, salespeople on live camera, and customized button CTAs. 

Hopin compared to other digital platforms:
* Video conferencing. There are good solutions available for video conferences for 2-20 participants, but once your meetings get to be over 20 people, Hopin’s “built for scale” venue approach provides a more engaging experience.
* Webinars. Webinars tend to be one-sided, unengaging, and passive. Hopin balances content with connection and puts the focus on real time face-to-face interaction between people.
* Virtual events. Many virtual event platforms can be outdated, cartoonish, and overly pre-packaged. Hopin revitalizes online events to be personal, flexible, sleek, modern, and efficient.
* Online communities. Facebook groups, Slack communities, email lists, and all the many ways people form communities online are missing an effective events-based platform for members to meet remotely, sustainably, accessibly, and collaborate meaningfully over live video.
