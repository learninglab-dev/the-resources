# Mind Mapping Tools

"Mind maps" refer to a family of diagrams that have a range of uses, from brainstorming to communication. They fall on continuums from expansive to distilled down to essentials, from free flowing to fixed visual grammar. Mind mapping tools can be used to build concept webs, flow charts, argument maps, tree diagrams, and more. The tools listed below all offer a free tier but differ in the designs they support and their ease of use for creating interactive diagrams and embedding your diagrams on other websites.
