# podcast structure workshop

This page contains links that may be helpful during the [Bok Center Learning Lab's](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) Podcasting Workshop for EXPOS20 Language, Identity, and Power.

Over the course of this hour, we are going to learn some tools for recording and editing in a variety of different software tools. We will spend most of the hour in breakout rooms devoted to each of the following applications:

* [Garageband](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/garageband)
* [Soundtrap](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/soundtrap)
* [Audacity](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/audacity)

We can also help out with any questions you have about Logic or Ableton if you decide to go with one of those tools instead.
