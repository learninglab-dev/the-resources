# PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Once we have all of our assets, we need to put them together by "compositing" them in a tool like Adobe After Effects. While a complete After Effects tutorial is beyond the scope of this workshop, you should [reach out to us](https://help.learninglab.xyz) if you'd like to learn more and we can put together a customized tutorial sequence for you given your specific needs.
