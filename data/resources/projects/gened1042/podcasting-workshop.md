# podcasting workshop

This page contains links that may be helpful during the [Bok Center Learning Lab's](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) Podcasting Workshop for GenEd 1042.

Over the course of this hour, we are going to learn some tools for recording and editing in a variety of different software tools. We will spend most of the hour in breakout rooms devoted to each of the following applications:

* [Garageband](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/garageband)
* [Soundtrap](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/soundtrap)
* [Audacity](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/audacity)

We can also help out with any questions you have about Logic or Ableton if you decide to go with one of those tools instead. 

As you begin to record your voice overs and interviews, here are a couple of resources to check out:
* [BBC remote recording protocols](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26256502) are really great
* [Pro Tools tips on remote recording](https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/2020/3/31/case-study-how-to-remote-record-during-the-covid-19-lockdown)

Here you can find a [google drive folder with the media assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TmVnzv3Z3sWznzVNUcZKQDCaeJDFA7ln) we will use in the breakout rooms today!

As you find yourself collaborating across a variety of distances and tools, you may find this [resource on audio collabs](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/audio-collaboration) helpful.

If you have any questions after the workshop, or at any time during the production of your podcast, feel free to reach out to use at [help.learninglab.xyz](http://help.learninglab.xyz) and we will put together a customized tutorial for you.
