## why audio authoring?

Typically, when encountering audio authoring, we think "podcast" or an audio essay of sorts. But across the wide array of projects you might tackle in the audio zone, the strengths of this modality in communicating academic ideas are numerous.  

Creating an academic audio essay calls upon many of the skills, tasks, and creative engagement involved in writing a final research paper: it requires choosing a topic, conducting research, defining a point of view, considering relevant theoretical frameworks and providing supporting evidence for the argument.

Audio authoring a podcast or radio play also challenges you to develop new media skills and carefully consider how to use voice and narrative style to reach a particular audience. You will manipulate auditory elements (e.g. voice, sound effects and/or music) into a cohesive message, with intentional tone, style, and pacing. And crucially, making podcasts can help you integrate first-person perspectives and personal experiences with the questions/data/issues that are important for engagement with your discipline/subject matter, a move that you must contend with as you move between your academic and non-academic lives.

Even when composing a piece of music you must make intentional choices, where even the seemingly merely aesthetic elements are playing a critically functional role in your academic argument about the apocalypse.

99% Invisible host Roman Mars performing a podcast live on-stage, complete with music beds and recorded interviews. This is less in the apolcalptic theme, but a great model for doing an audio project "live."

These two are sort of in between the transition between worlds, the feeling of unsettledness, of grasping for solid ground…the first here is a choir, the second an orchestra. The first perhaps a little more the beautiful side of being in the in-between, the second more the disturbing side.
