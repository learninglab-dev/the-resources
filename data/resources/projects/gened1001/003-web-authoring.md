# Web Authoring

## Why web authoring?

Because the web is powerful! Almost anything (digital?) you can imagine can live on the web. Web authoring is an excellent choice of medium if your project combines text and other media, such as images or maps. It's also particularly strong if your content needs to be interactive in some way. But the expansiveness of the web means you as a creator will need to make targeted choices if you choose web authoring as your medium.

In addition, web authoring comprises a variety of things you might make, each of which communicates differently:

- Some pages on the web are literally _documents_. They are meant to be read like any other paper or article or story you might write. However, because these documents are on the web, they might embed images, videos, gifs, or links to other resources.

- Some sites use a map or timeline or gallery or slide show or other graphical representation to organize information. There might be an intended reading order, but the viewer might also be free to explore.

- Still other sites are true _interactives_. What the user sees or reads depends somehow on what the user does. Interactives include choose-your-own-adventure stories, games, and animations that respond to mouse or keyboard inputs.

This breakdown suggests that a key decision point in web authoring is the level of interactivity. Are you using the web to combine text and other media? Or do you need to build your site in a tool that will allow your user to interact?

And why from an academic communication standpoint might you take advantage of these features of the web?
