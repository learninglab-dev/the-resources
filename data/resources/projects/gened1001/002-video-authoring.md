## MODELS

The following videos were shared in the workshop linked above. Below each video you'll find a photo of the timeline for each completed video to give you a sense of the overall composition.

### Style 1 - Video Diary
This is an attempt at creating an intro to a post-apocalyptic video, all recorded with a smartphone and edited in Final Cut Pro X
