# Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop truly does it all: from photo editing and compositing to digital painting, animation, and graphic design.

* Photoshop can edit photos to a similar degree. You can crop and retouch photos or enhance colors, contrast, or adjust sharpness and blurriness.
* Photoshop is also stellar for making digital art. You can emulate classic brushstrokes or aim for a more modern design with brush add-ons that are available on through Adobe.
* With blending brushes or layers, you can combine different colors to create a painting. You can apply digital paintbrush effects to your image, ranging from oil textures, to charcoal, and ink.
* Photoshop is also very competent in graphic design, featuring some of the basic tools Illustrator expands upon (making it a great testing grounds for your designs!).
* Front-end web design: Ps is great for making mock-ups of your website.
