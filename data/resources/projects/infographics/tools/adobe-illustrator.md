# Adobe Illustrator

Illustrator is the industry-standard vector graphics software: use it to create graphics and illustrations like logos, infographics, charts, diagrams, comics, and even fonts.

Illustrator specializes in **vector graphics**; vector artwork is special because it can be rescaled without sacrificing quality (unlike rasterized images). This makes Illustrator excellent for designing anything from really tiny (web icons) to really big (billboard) designs.

Specifically for science, Illustrator can be used for making graphs or modifying existing graphs/charts you've made! Break free of the bondage of Excel or even R, Python, or STATA and make beautiful & informative graphs! [Here's](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/) just how far Illustrator can take you.
