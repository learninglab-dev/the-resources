# Virtual Museums
Virtual 3D museums can organize objects in virtual space, creating relationships that might be difficult to articulate in words alone; the organization of the space itself can make and argument or tell a story.

### PEOPLE
The SketchUp workshop features:
* Leah, Media and Design Fellow for EALC
* Casey, Learning Lab Studio Coordinator

### QUESTIONS
If you have any questions after the workshop, or at any time during the production of your museum exhibit, feel free to reach out to use at [help.learninglab.xyz](http://help.learninglab.xyz) and we will put together a customized tutorial for you.

## SketchUp Resource Guide

### Getting started in SketchUp
1. [Install SketchUp on your computer.](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd115/sketchup-install) 
2. **Watch the Bok Center Learning Lab [tutorial](https://youtu.be/BQEbQ5qTE_w).** It goes through all the basic tools, introduces keyboard shortcuts (a _must-learn_ to save time!) and will help you with gallery-specific tasks!

2. [Sketch-Up How-To Walkthrough](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/getting-started-sketchup#qrc): This guide tells you how to set up your templates to fit your personal needs, including setting measurements to be in inches/feet or centimeters/meters. 
3. Use the **[Sketch-Up Quick Reference Card](https://www.sketchup.com/quick-reference-cards/sketchup-2020/en)** for extra tool keyboard shortcuts. The website has reference cards for both Mac and PC. 
4. **Do self-paced _free_ tutorial courses at** [SketchUp Learn](https://learn.sketchup.com/)! These are whole mini courses just for you to learn how to do SketchUp, replete with videos, guided projects, and more. 
5. **Watch and go through these _excellent_ beginner tutorial videos with** **[Designer Hacks on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwoqfe6t6FHllZMQOXjyMC5t1XoprDAnR)and** **[TheSketchUpEssentials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEQT0qjXe6zgmMMP6ZzoUDG_fdjcRmCQE). **I watched these two makers’ videos almost exclusively when I got stuck when making my gallery template. 
6. Use the `Window > Instructor` in the Sketch-Up desktop version to get tips on how to do things as you are working. (In the free online version, you can activate the instructor by clicking on the graduation hat on the right-hand toolbar. 
7. **Watch [SketchUp Skill Builders’](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bndkJaV8A5VmrwvxMw-IYgSJLlV-vjH) videos:** 5-minute or so guides for a variety of different aspects of SketchUp!
8. **Use the [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)** to download and import free models that you can then alter (or keep just as they are) for your gallery!

### The Best SketchUp Video Tutorials

Again, any videos by **Designer Hacks on YouTube and TheSketchUpEssentials** are **helpful.** I cannot recommend these videos highly enough. The ones I found particularly helpful are: 

*   [USING THE STYLES TOOLBAR IN SKETCHUP - All tools explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAuwFZ9JX2M) Shows you how to go into (and more importantly, out of) X-ray mode, hidden line styles, etc.
*   [Tips for ALIGNING Objects TO THE GROUND in Sketchup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0TtfboMUY8) and [8 Tips for MOVING OBJECTS PRECISELY in SketchUp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y41qudBpg-o) are **must-sees** to avoid hours of frustration.

*   [SketchUp Mini Lessons - Aligning Different Shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erCtuy_UBt4): How to move objects so they fit into one another. This is a great tutorial to show you how to use arrows to lock in on axises so you can move them more precisely in space.

*   **ALL IMPORTANT!** [How to Add a Texture to a Curved Surface in SketchUp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_inpiCqdkk&t=442s): **Also covered in the Bok Center Tutorial.** **_This is perhaps the most important skill you will learn (and use over and over) in making your artworks!_**
*   [How to Scale to a Specific Size in Sketchup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsM7u2d6JI0): Helpful for scaling objects to a specific proportion. If you want to make the height and width different lengths, though, I’d recommend making a line _outside _your grouped object, but on the object’s surface. Then, before you complete making the line, type in the measurement and then clicking “enter.” Then, scale your object to fit that line as close as possible. Delete the line, and then do this for the other side. **(Video tutorial coming)**

*   [How to Install Plugins, and Extensions in Sketchup (software)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UxaAocenEM): This can help you with adding plugins for projects like push/pulling curved surfaces (see below). 
*   [How to Push/Pull Curved Surfaces in SketchUp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWjOgh57TP4): This one takes a bit of time to do in practice, but once you download and install the plugins, life will be so much easier for you!Also see [Push and Pull Curved Surfaces in this SketchUp Extension - Plugin of the Week #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGMypUPHzKs).
*   [How to Change the Unit Of Measurements in SketchUp](https://help.sketchup.com/en/managing-units-measurement#set-units)
*   **IMPORTANT!** [How to See High-Resolution Images on SketchUp](https://forums.sketchup.com/t/when-i-import-a-high-resolution-landplan-into-sketchup-resolution-gets-obliterated-how-can-i-avoid-this/81328) (this may slow down your computer)

### Advanced/Nerd Zone:

*   Want a crazy how-to (without words) on how to make a 3D Godzilla? I’ve got you covered with this [Sketchup Godzilla Modeling + Enscape Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgBPZQ_tyjA) video...or you can just pick up a ready-made one [here](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/2837e06f-c9fc-4420-93c6-ef9b97d66a5a/Godzilla) or [here](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/3070a9f12554d608ac18658048f8f7a9/godzilla) from the SketchUp 3D Warehouse.
