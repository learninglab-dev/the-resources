- Once downloaded, launch the .dmg/.exe file and follow the instructions.
- Once the program is installed, you'll be faced with a page to Sign in, choose `Add Classic License` instead.

#### If this isn't installing properly:

- Check that you are entering the license codes into the correct version of SketchUp Pro. For example, if you purchased Sketchup Pro 2021, the license codes will not work in Sketchup Pro 2020.

- Make sure you completely uninstall all previous or trial versions of SketchUp and SketchUp Pro before installing. You must have old empty SketchUp folders deleted and software properly uninstalled and restart your machine before you begin.
