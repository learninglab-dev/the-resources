# Posters and Infographics
In posters and infographics you can include text, just as you might in a paper, but you can also offer viewers quantitative data visualizations, maps, or flowcharts showing causal relationships.

**Check back soon for information about when the workshop will be held**. In the meantime, if you have a question or have found inspiration you want help recreating, get in touch with us at [help.learninglab.xyz](http://help.learninglab.xyz).
