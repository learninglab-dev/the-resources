In a podcast, your voice will often achieve an intimacy or approachable informality that can be more effective at connecting to your audience, and you have tools at your disposal (pacing, sound effects, music beds) that can add additional layers of meaning.

## why podcasting?

Typically, when encountering podcasts, we think of audio authoring, or an audio essay of sorts. But across the wide array of projects you might tackle in the audio zone, the strengths of this modality in communicating academic ideas are numerous.  

Creating an academic audio essay calls upon many of the skills, tasks, and creative engagement involved in writing a final research paper: it requires choosing a topic, conducting research, defining a point of view, considering relevant theoretical frameworks and providing supporting evidence for the argument.

Audio authoring a podcast or radio play also challenges you to develop new media skills and carefully consider how to use voice and narrative style to reach a particular audience. You will manipulate auditory elements (e.g. voice, sound effects and/or music) into a cohesive message, with intentional tone, style, and pacing. And crucially, making podcasts can help you integrate first-person perspectives and personal experiences with the questions/data/issues that are important for engagement with your discipline/subject matter, a move that you must contend with as you move between your academic and non-academic lives.

Even when composing a piece of music you must make intentional choices, where even the seemingly merely aesthetic elements are playing a critically functional role in your academic argument about the apocalypse.
