## Zoom
Zoom can be a useful tool for capturing interview footage to augment your presentation.

## Setting up your Zoom to record at the highest quality
There are loads of settings under the hood on how to optimize your Zoom session recordings. This section will guide you through how to turn them on.

### For meetings recording locally
If you are planning to record by hitting the **Record** button in Zoom, there are some settings to optimize before you begin.

1. Click the arrow next to `Start/Stop Video` and click `Video Settings`. 
2. Open the `Recording` tab on the left.
3. Make sure that the following options are selected:
    * Optimize for 3rd party video editor
    * Record video during screen sharing
    * If audio is important, consider selecting "Record a separate audio file for each participant
    * Also take the time to select a folder to store your recording in.

![Your settings should look like this](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-F01B6HB7B4Z/screen_shot_2020-09-16_at_12.58.25_pm.png?pub_secret=7761739847)

Once the meeting ends, a box will pop up letting you know that your recording is saving.


### For meetings set to Automatically record
 [Alternatively, here is a short video walkthrough as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty0CJH5yzWw&feature=youtu.be)

2. Click **Settings** in the panel on the left, then click **Recording**.
