# Crafting Your Pitch

Here's a quick guide to get you started as you plan out the structure of your pitch. As is only fitting, the guide is itself a 3-step pitch.

## 1. The Opportunity

You have an awesome idea. You've done the research; you have a plan of action. Now, you just need to convince the relevant stakeholders to enact your proposal.

You know you want your pitch video to be both compelling and easy to follow. Structuring your video in a few key segments is a strong way to accomplish this.  


## 2. The Plan

A classic approach to structuring a pitch is to divide your presentation into three memorable steps. You might have seen these pitches framed in one of these ways:

 Version 1 |  Version 2 | Version 3
--- | --- | ---
What is | Problem | Why this?
What could be | Solution | Why now?
Call to Action | Ask | Why you?

(And also Opportunity-Plan-Call as used in this guide.)

In **Step 1**, you talk about the status quo. Depending on your audience and your goals, you might frame it negatively as a problem to be solved or more neutrally as the current situation. What needs are there? Are there things that are going well that can be built off of? Where are current efforts, policies, projects etc. falling short.   

In **Step 2**, you present your vision and plan of action. Be as concrete as possible. How does your plan address the issues you raised in Step 1? What makes your plan stand out from other iniatives? How do we get started?

Finally, in **Step 3** you call on your stakeholders. It might be as simple as "Join us!"; or you might over first concrete steps that they can take to help.

While all of this may sound a little business speak, it's not all that different from a proposal you might write for a research paper. You begin with a reseach question and its stakes. What is the current state of the field? This is Step 1. You then present your thesis or hypotheses. This Step 2. Finally, you present the approach you'll take toward answering the question and/or supporting your view. While this isn't an ask for someone else, it's a way of laying out next steps for yourself, so it's an analoge of Step 3.


## 3. The Call

Craft an amazing pitch!

Since your pitch will take the form of a video, we've also put together some resources to help you use the medium of video to augment the elements of your pitch:
