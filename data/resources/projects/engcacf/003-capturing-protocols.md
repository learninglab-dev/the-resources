# CAPTURE TIPS AND PROTOCOLS #

If you are going to get the participants in your media project to capture themselves, you'll need to provide them with some guidance on how they should be capturing themselves. It's hard enough producing stylistic continuity when you are capturing all the footage yourself, let alone when you are distributing the task to participants with varying levels of experience. Below you will find
1. some really basic tips and tutorials that can "level up" your participants' video and audio acquisition skills, and
2. some ideas on how you might develop a "capture protocol" that helps multiple participants produce stylistically similar results


## EXAMPLES OF CAPTURE TIPS FOR PARTICIPANT-DRIVEN PRODUCTIONS ##

You have to be realistic about the amount of information your participants are going to be able to take in, so, in general, a short series of tips or requirements makes more sense than a ten-page manual.
