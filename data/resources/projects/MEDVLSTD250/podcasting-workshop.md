# podcasting workshop

This page contains links that may be helpful during the [Bok Center Learning Lab's](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) Podcasting Workshop for MEDVLSTD250.

Over the course of this hour, we are going to learn some tools for recording and editing in a variety of different software tools. We will devote time to exploring each of the following applications:

* [Garageband](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/garageband)
* [Soundtrap](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/gened1042/soundtrap)

We can also help out with any questions you have about Logic or Ableton if you decide to go with one of those tools instead.
