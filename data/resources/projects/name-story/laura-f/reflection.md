# Reflection on Name Story Prompt

## Written on Slack

I honestly could've talked even longer so thank you for encouraging me to make it short :slightly_smiling_face:
but also- this reminds me of an icebreaker i did with my entryway freshman year where we had to tell the story of how we got our names and then everyone had to guess whether that was the true story or not
(so you could totally make up your name origin, it just had to be a convincing enough lie)
