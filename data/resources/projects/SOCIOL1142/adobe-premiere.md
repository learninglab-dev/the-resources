CineCom's video on 5 Fast & Easy Creative Effects in Premiere Pro. In it, they run through and five different tools in Premiere that go beyond simple footage splicing, giving short and easy to follow tutorials for each. These effects include color strobing, scribble effects, and lens flares. The video does spend a bit of time talking in the beginning, and goes on a tangent to advertise a stock video website, but the effects are fun and super useful for more creative projects like music videos or essay films. They're also all very easy to use and get the hang of!
