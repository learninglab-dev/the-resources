# Davinci Resolve

Davinci Resolve is an incredibly powerful editing program developed by Blackmagic Design. They offer it for free to anyone, with the option of buying an upgrade that unlocks certain functions. For the most part those functions, while totally amazing, aren't necessary to the vast majority of everyday video/audio/color tasks. So what they have here is a software that rivals Premiere, Avid and Final Cut Pro X that is 100% free to use!
