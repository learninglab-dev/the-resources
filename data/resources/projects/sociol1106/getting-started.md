# SOCIOL1106: Infographics Resources

Here are links to the resources we've complied to help you create infographics:

### 1. Google Slides
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">
    We'll use Google Slides to create infographics both because they're <span style="font-weight:bold">easy</span> to work with but perhaps, more importantly this term, because they're <span style="font-weight:bold">collaborative</span>. Of course, if members of your group are familiar with other graphic design tools, e.g. Illustrator, and you want to make elements of you infographic there and paste in Google Slides, that works too!
