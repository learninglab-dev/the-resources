The Learning Lab has complied some resources here to help you create your infographics, but if you don't find exactly what you're looking for, or want a walkthrough of something specific, or run into challenges, don't hesitate to submit a question at [**help.learninglab.xyz**](http://help.learninglab.xyz)!

### 1. Google Slides
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type:none">
    We'll use Google Slides to create infographics both because they're <span style="font-weight:bold">efficient</span> to work with but perhaps, more importantly this term, because they're <span style="font-weight:bold">collaborative</span>. Of course, if members of your group are familiar with other graphic design tools, e.g. Illustrator, and you want to make elements of you infographic there and paste in Google Slides, that works too!

  <li style="list-style-type:none">
    While we imagine you all are Slides experts by now, we've curated some templates and tips here: <a href="./google-slides-tips.md">Slides Tips</a>
  </li>
</ul>

### 2. Graphic Design
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type:none">
    The best infographics leverage principles and elements of graphic design to tell their stories. These principles show up both at the macro level-- What does the grid layout of your poster say about the relatioships between your figures?-- and also on the micro level-- How do the colors you've chosen for that one chart represent the contrast between categories?
  </li>
  </br>
  <li style="list-style-type:none">
    Canva has a nice <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/">overview of design elements</a> for reference.
  </li>
  </br>
  <li style="list-style-type:none">
    We've also created some resources if you want to dig deeper into specific elements:
