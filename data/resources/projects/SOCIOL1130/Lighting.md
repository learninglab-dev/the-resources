## Lighting

* Natural and diffused light (e.g., sunlight through a translucent window shade, or under a tree that has a large canopy of leaves) work great for selfie videos
* It is often good to position your face at roughly 45 degrees from your light source, so you can create a gentle shadow on one side of your face.
* When possible, recording in the early morning or late afternoon/early evening, will offer a softer and more flattering natural light
* Pay attention to dramatic disparities in the light in different parts of your shot, and adjust your shot as needed:
  * (i.e., You may think it's a good idea to shoot a selfie video with your back right up against a bright window, but it's possible that your face may end up being very dark and underexposed, and the window may being overexposed and way too bright)
* Watch out for glare in glasses, and adjust the position of your head and body if necessary
