Throughout this term you will be able to make use of the [Bok Center's Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) for help as you work on your final blueprint for action. In doing so, you may want to choose a multimedia storytelling medium that enhances the argument that you are seeking to make. Below are some options and associated resources for you to explore.

### PODCASTING AND AUDIO CAPTURE

In a podcast, your voice will often achieve an intimacy or approachable informality that can be more effective at connecting to your audience, and you have tools at your disposal (pacing, sound effects, music beds) that can add additional layers of meaning.
