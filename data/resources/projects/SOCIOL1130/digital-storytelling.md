Throughout this term you will be able to make use of the [Bok Center's Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) for help as you work on your final blueprint for action. In doing so, you may want to choose a multimedia storytelling medium that enhances the argument that you are seeking to make. Below are some options and associated resources for you to explore.

### PODCASTING AND AUDIO CAPTURE

In a podcast, your voice will often achieve an intimacy or approachable informality that can be more effective at connecting to your audience, and you have tools at your disposal (pacing, sound effects, music beds) that can add additional layers of meaning.

### CAPTURING IN ZOOM

Zoom is a convenient and solid tool for recording interviews, and can of course be used to record yourself as well.

### SMARTPHONE VIDEO RECORDING

You don't need an expensive DSLR to capture effective and compelling video. And chances are that you have an amazing and capable camera sitting in your pocket right now.

### LIGHTING

If you are going to be capturing your own visual media through Zoom, from your smartphone, or from any other device, then lighting is an essential element to consider as well.

### FRAMING & COMPOSITION

In addition to lighting, you want your subject(s) to be framed in your video in a way that is intentional; you want your video to effectively convey the content as well as tone and emotion. Executing thoughtful framing and composition in your videos can help you achieve both of these goals.

### VIDEO EDITING
Once you've completed capturing your media, the next step is to begin assembling and editing together your footage

### WEB-BASED STORIES
There are also multiple ways to assemble the media you capture on the web in forms other than videos. Two commonly used tools for academic projects include [**Timeline.js**](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) and [**Storymap.js**](https://storymap.knightlab.com/?utm_source=syndicate&utm_campaign=onextrapixel-oct2016&utm_medium=post), which are ways of telling multimedia stories that move through time and space, respectively.

### HOSTING ON SCALAR
You will be building your projects on the [Students in Service and Leadership at Harvard](https://scalar.fas.harvard.edu/studentpower/index) Scalar page.
