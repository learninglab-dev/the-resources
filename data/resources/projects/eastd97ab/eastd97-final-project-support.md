# EASTD97 Final Project Support

Throughout this term you will be able to make use of the [Bok Center's Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) help as you work on your final projects. Whether you are creating a podcast, a storymap, or have another idea you'd like to persue the Learning Lab will be there to help you over the course of the term.

## PODCASTING
In a podcast, your voice will often achieve an intimacy or approachable informality that can be more effective at connecting to your audience, and you have tools at your disposal (pacing, sound effects, music beds) that can add additional layers of meaning.

The podcast editing tools we typically support are:
* [Garageband](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/garageband)
* [Soundtrap](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/soundtrap)
* [Audacity](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/audacity)

We can also help out with any questions you have about Logic or Ableton if you decide to go with one of those tools instead.
