# podcasting editing

This page was created by the [Bok Center Learning Lab](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/learning-lab) for EASTD97ab: Introduction to the Study of East Asia: Issues and Methods.

The podcast editing tools we typically support are:
* [Garageband](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/garageband)
* [Soundtrap](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/soundtrap)
* [Audacity](http://resources.learninglab.xyz/simple/projects/eastd97ab/audacity)

We can also help out with any questions you have about Logic or Ableton if you decide to go with one of those tools instead.
