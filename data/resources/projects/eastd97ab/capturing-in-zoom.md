## Setting up your Zoom to record at the highest quality
There are loads of settings under the hood on how to optimize your Zoom session recordings. This section will guide you through how to turn them on.

### For meetings recording locally
If you are planning to record by hitting the **Record** button in Zoom, there are some settings to optimize before you begin.

1. Click the arrow next to `Start/Stop Video` and click `Video Settings`. 
2. Open the `Recording` tab on the left.
3. Make sure that the following options are selected:
    * Optimize for 3rd party video editor
    * Record video during screen sharing
    * If audio is important, consider selecting "Record a separate audio file for each participant
    * Also take the time to select a folder to store your recording in.

Once the meeting ends, a box will pop up letting you know that your recording is saving.



### For meetings set to Automatically record

Note: You'll have to be the meeting creator in order for this to work!

1. Start by going to [harvard.zoom.us](harvard.zoom.us).
2. Click **Settings** in the panel on the left, then click **Recording**.
That will open a big panel that looks like this:

3. You're going to want to go wild clicking all of these boxes **except** "Display participants' names in the recording" and "Add a timestamp to the recording". This will make sure you have all of the possible recordings for any meeting you are hosting.
