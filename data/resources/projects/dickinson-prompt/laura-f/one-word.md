# Just One Word

## Word Chosen: "Mystery"

I love the way this word looking in Dickinson’s slanted handwriting. The fact that you have to almost work to read the word itself adds to the mysterious effect of the whole poem. Additionally, with this being the final word the reader is left with, the word “mystery” further compounds the obscurity and ambiguity created because it provides no concrete answers for any of the questions inspired the such abstract language of the piece. In fact, it may leave the reader even more curious and almost unsettled than they were before. Though, this interpretation shifts as we take a step backward and look at some of the earlier words in the piece.
