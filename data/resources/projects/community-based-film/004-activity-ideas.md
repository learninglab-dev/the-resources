# ACTIVITY IDEAS #

To learn any skill, you need to repeatedly practice it, and also to get feedback that helps you know if your practice is hitting the mark (whether from an instructor or from your own assessment of your work--i.e. seeing whether the ball goes in the hoop as you practice your free throws).  

The challenge of learning media skills is that it just takes loads and loads of **time** to complete a media project of any meaningful scope or depth or complexity. The following activities are designed to target extremely specific elements of media-rich storytelling, and to do so with extremely quick activities that tighten up the feedback loop.
