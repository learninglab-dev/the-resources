hi

We hope the term is off to a good start! As promised, here a couple of tip sheets and activity ideas for section, each designed as a way of helping students with the difficulties of capturing doc-style footage and particularly interviews this year. 

As we discussed, it could be the case that many students will want to get their documentary subjects (or "participants"") to record interviews and environments **themselves** this year in order to maintain social distancing.  So these resources are intended as models of what your students might want to produce for their participants--that is to say, these are not intended as "advanced shooting tips for film students," but more as ideas for how your students might work to produce a pool of footage that has a a certain consistency (this _could_ be a sophisticated sort of stylistic consistency, but it could also simply be a baseline level of audio or lighting quality!)

So in the attached docs, you'll find

* a list of quick tips on capturing **interviews in Zoom** if your students haven't done this before
* some quick audio tips, including ways to clean up audio in Premiere
* some models of the sort of **"capture protocol"** or **"shot list"** (along with audio tips) that your students might create for their documentary projects if they can't acquire all the interview footage themselves (i.e. if they need to request that their interview subjects self-capture with smartphone cameras)
* some instructor-facing **activity ideas** you might  want to use in section to 
	* get students to test out some **visual ideas for a capture protocol** or shot list.  
	* get students to think about **storytelling through audio** (again with a view to developing instructions they might distribute to participants in their projects)

	These are really quick group activities that get all 10 or so of the students to simultaneously capture according to the template, so that in 2 minutes you can give them a quick experience that they can then reflect on. The bonus is that as a byproduct you'll have a pool of footage that will be fun to play with during your editing workshops.

In a "meta" or self-reflexive way, I suppose these activities themselves could give your students some ideas for activities that might launch their documentary projects too (i.e. they themselves might want to set up a Zoom-based "intro workshop" for the 4-5 subjects they are profiling during which the subjects shoot a quick 30 seconds or so of video to learn the capture protocol, etc.)

In any case, we hope some of these docs are helpful, even if only to give you better ideas yourselves! But do keep in touch if there is anything at all we can do, whether this would mean assisting in running some of these activities in the section or hosting an optional workshop, or just working with students to troubleshoot any of the technical problems and hurdles that are sure to emerge this year!

best,

Marlon
