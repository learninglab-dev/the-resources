# Serif and Sans Serif Fonts

*Design almost always incorporates text, and the font that you choose is integral to the way that we interact with design and information.*

Typography categorizes fonts into two separate groups: **serif and sans serif**. 

### Serif fonts are the oldest modern typeface and what you will usually see in print. 

* Fonts in this family include Times New Roman, Georgia, and minion pro. 
* They are characterized by *small strokes called serifs that extend from the letters*. 
* When we see these fonts, we often associate them with **sophistication and formality**. 

### Sans serifs lack the small strokes extending from the letters. 

* These typefaces are often considered more **modern and sleek**. 
* Fonts in this family include Calibri, Futura, and Arial. 

### Where you use certain font families and how you pair fonts is an integral element to design. 

* For *serif fonts*, you’ll often find them used for *large amounts of body text, as the serif strokes help guide the eye through text*. 

* Often you’ll see *sans serif fonts as headers for text, as their bold minimalism easily catches the eye from a distance*. 
  * You will often also see it frequently used *online or in ads to create a more modern feel*. 

### Always be deliberate when pairing fonts, known as typographic hierarchy. 

* Bold headers can draw the reader in and organize groups of information. 
* Choose fonts intended for readability when placing large blocks of text. 

A general rule is to **limit your composition to two fonts maximum**, as more than that usually creates messy and overwhelming compositions. 

Research into what fonts go well together, and feel free to experiment to find which fonts work best for the message and tone of your design.
