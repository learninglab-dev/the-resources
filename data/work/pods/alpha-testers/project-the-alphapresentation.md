**Description**
We are working with the Ableton Push to incorporate as many multimedia abilities as possible, such that the Push can launch video, audio, still images, documents, open links, even lighting cues all via MIDI inputs. The way we will cap off this project is to create our own fully immersive presentation that showcases all of the capabilities of the Push. We envision this to be a 5-10 minute long “lecture” on a fun topic that will include interactive elements for the audience.
    
**Rationale**
This will be an important contribution to student learning because it will facilitate transitions between media outlets in presentations and broaden the range of media available in creating a learning experience (workshops, presentations, etc.)
    
Trying out new media for generating academic ideas, helping us get better at something
    

**Done**
We have learned how to use the Push to create music tracks and explored how to use the interface through this process
    
We have started research on the MAX/MSP/JITTER plug-ins that align with our project goals

**Doing**
    

-   Week 1 (October 31)
    

	-   Video
    

-   Week 2 (November 7)
    

	-   Lighting
    

-   Week 3 (November 14)
    

	-   Creating presentation content
    
	-   Packaging (Putting together one tool for all the media outputs)
    

-   Week 4 (November 21)
    

	-   Finish packaging and presentation
    

-   Individual
    

	-   Researching and trying out different plug-ins
 
 **Community**
It would be useful to continue to work with David and get feedback from him based on his experience with these plug-ins. It would also be helpful to hear from people working on learning experiences on what they would like to be able to launch from the Push.
 
For people excited about our project they are more than welcome to jump in! A good place to start would be getting familiar with the plug-ins we are using (currently exploring VIZZable) through video tutorials and the MAX/MSP/JITTER for music book.

We would like to give a 5-10 minute long “lecture” on a fun topic that will include interactive elements for the audience using the Push as our final deliverable, and this can also be used during the showcase!
