# Notes!

## AudioPeak Project Launch Doc

### ft. Jad & Sophie & more!

Here, we'll keep track of all of our **progress** and *notes*.

> Our plan is to find a way to scrub LL video files for audio peaks, and turn those moments into GIFs, through a command line function. Those GIFs could then automatically be uploaded to an Express App for everyone to enjoy!

Steps:
- [ ] Research relevant command line plug-ins.
- [ ] Create the function!
- [ ] Create an Express app to upload resulting GIFs on.
- [ ] And, take notes the whole time!

`print("great job researching!")`

Useful functions:
- `$ sox old.wav new.wav trim [SECOND TO START] [SECONDS DURATION]`
	- extract parts of an audio file
- `$ sox foo.wav -e stat`
	- get info for an audio file (including amplitude)
- `$ ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac`
	- extract audio from a video file
- ` $ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 01:10:27 -to 02:18:51 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4`
	- example of trimming a video file

Potential process:
1. extract the audio file from the video file
2. get the stats for the audio file
3. isolate the moments with maximum amplitude (or close to it?)
	- we'll need to write a new command line program for this
4. store those seconds & trim the video file using those seconds
5. make that trimmed video file into a GIF
6. upload that GIF to the Express app
